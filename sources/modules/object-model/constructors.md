## C++ object model: constructor

_Skeleton descriptions are typeset in italic text,_
_so please don't remove these descriptions when editing the topic._

### Overview

_Provides a short natural language abstract of the moduleâ€™s contents._
_Specifies the different levels of teaching._

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level             Objective
----------------- ------------------------------------------------------
Foundational:      Declaration of constructors

Main:              Initialization and overloading   

Advanced:          TBD 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Motivation

_Why is this important?_
_Why do we want to learn/teach this topic?_

Constructors are fundamental to generate objects from classes and structs, so understanding them is essential to work with objcets.

### Topic introduction

_Very brief introduction to the topic._

### Foundational: Basic use of constructors

#### Background/Required Knowledge

A student:

1. should know the notion of classes and structs 

#### Student outcomes

_A list of things "a student should be able to" after the curriculum._
_The next word should be an action word and testable in an exam._
_Max 5 items._

A student should be able to:

1. Add constructors to classes and structs
2. Explain different types of initialization
3. Explain compiler provided constructors when these are provided, what these do, and when these go away
4. Explain differences between creating an object and declare a variable

#### Points to cover

* Overloading of constructors and default arguments
* Copy constrcutor and destructor
* Constructors can be used to initialize class members 
* 

#### Caveats

_This section mentions subtle points to understand, like anything resulting in
implementation-defined, unspecified, or undefined behavior._

* programming user interfaces in C++ and in general require plenty of boiler plate code
* API calls are specific to one library and might not be transferable to other libraries
* Some libraries are written in C

### Main: Command of supporting mechanisms and tools

#### Background/Required Knowledge

* All of the above.

#### Student outcomes

A student should be able to:

1. add more advanced elements, like tables or images
2. handle multiple windows
3. show error and warning popups
4. use different forms of IO, like keyboard, mouse, or touch pad
5. explain basic of fonts and accessibility

#### Caveats

*  programming user interfaces is rather complex and might not applicable for most students

#### Points to cover

* More advanced API calls and design patterns

### Advanced: Technicalities and tools

_These are important topics that are not expected to be covered but provide
guidance where one can continue to investigate this topic in more depth._

* Internationalization
* Font designers
* Hardware acceleration
* Custom widget generation
